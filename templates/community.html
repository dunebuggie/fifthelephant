      <p>
        One of the unique features of The Fifth Elephant (and <a href="http://hasgeek.com/">HasGeek</a> events in general) is the community’s defining role. The speakers, the curators and the attendees are all from the same community.
      </p>
      <p class="regular">
        Anyone is welcome to <a href="http://funnel.hasgeek.com/fifthel2013/">propose a session</a>. Participants who have purchased conference tickets will vote on session proposals. The Programme Committee steering Fifth Elephant 2013 will also vote on submissions and balance the community voting. The Programme Committee consists data analysts and big data practitioners.
      </p>
      <p class="regular">
        Proposal submissions are reviewed on the basis of use cases, how a problem was solved, or why a particular technology and/or approach was adopted for solving the problem. Proposers can refer to open source technologies and tools available for storage, analytics and visualisation in their submissions.
