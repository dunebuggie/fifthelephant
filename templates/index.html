  <p>
    In 2013, commodity hardware and computing capacity for storing and processing large
    and small volumes of data are easily available on demand. The bigger issues pertain
    to questions of how to scale data processing, handle data diversity, manage infrastructure costs,
    decide which technologies work best for different contexts and problems, and build products from
    the insights and intelligence that the data is presenting to you.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The Fifth Elephant 2013 is a three-day workshop and conference on big data,
    storage and analytics, with product demos and hacker corners.

          Participants were exposed to some of the popular and emerging technology stacks for storing and processing big data. They learnt about <a href="http://hasgeek.tv/fifthelephant/2012-1/57-seeing-through-the-haze-advanced-visualisations-using-python">programming languages</a> and <a href="http://hasgeek.tv/fifthelephant/2012-1/52-lessons-from-the-evolution-of-mayavi">libraries</a> available for producing compelling visualisations. In the analytics track, statisticians and analysts spoke about various <a href="http://hasgeek.tv/fifthelephant/2012-1/530-goldee-udani-finding-signal-in-the-noise-how-to-put-big-data-to-use">tools</a> and <a href="http://hasgeek.tv/fifthelephant/2012-1/531-the-science-behind-predictive-analytics-a-text-mining-perspective">techniques</a> for building business intelligence and <a href="http://hasgeek.tv/fifthelephant/2012-1/42-telling-stories-with-data">telling stories with data</a>. Overall, the first edition presented the multiple meanings and facets of big data to participants and helped them in understanding the emerging ecosystem.
