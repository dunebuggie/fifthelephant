      <p>This procedure has been adopted from the Ada Initiative's guide titled “<a href="http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/Conference_anti-harassment/Responding_to_reports">Conference anti-harassment/Responding to Reports</a>”.</p>
    </header>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>All conference staff and programme committee members will be wearing a badge with the word “CREW” on it. The crew will be prepared to handle the incident.  Our crew members are informed of the <a href="/2013/code-of-conduct">code of conduct policy</a> and guide for handling harassment at the conference. <em>There will be a mandatory crew meeting onsite at the conference when this will be reiterated.</em></p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Report the harassment incident to a crew member. All reports will remain confidential. A written or emailed report is preferred as it will record the facts for later reference.</p>
        <p>When reporting the event to the crew, try to gather as much information as available, but do not interview people about the incident. </p>
        <p>The important information consists of:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Identifying information (name) of the participant doing the harassing</li>
          <li>The behaviour that was in violation</li>
          <li>The approximate time of the behaviour (if different than the time the report was made)</li>
          <li>The circumstances surrounding the incident</li>
          <li>Other people involved in the incident</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Crew members will assist you in wrting the report. They are well informed on how to deal with the incident and how to proceed further.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Involve police only at a victim's request.</p>
      </li>
    </ol>
