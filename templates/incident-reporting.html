      <p>This procedure has been adopted from the Ada Initiative's guide titled “<a href="http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/Conference_anti-harassment/Responding_to_reports">Conference anti-harassment/Responding to Reports</a>”.</p>
    </header>
    <ol>
      <li><p>HasGeek staff and volunteers will wear white coloured lanyards with word “HasGeek” printed in purple and orange colour. Staff and volunteers will be prepared to handle the incident. Our crew members are informed of the code of conduct policy and a general guide for handling harassment at the conference.</p></li>
      <li><p>There will be a mandatory crew meeting onsite at the conference where this will be reiterated.</p></li>
      <li><p>Report the harassment incident to a crew member. All reports will remain confidential.</p></li>
      <li><p>When reporting the event to the crew, try to gather as much information as available, but do not interview people about the incident.</p></li>
      <li><p>The important information consists of:
        <ul>
          <li>Identifying information (name) of the participant doing the harassing.</li>
          <li>The behaviour that was in violation.</li>
          <li>The approximate time of the behaviour (if different than the time the report was made).</li>
          <li>The circumstances surrounding the incident.</li>
          <li>Other people involved in the incident.</li>
        </ul></p>
      </li>
      <li><p>Crew members will assist you in writing the report.</p></li>
      <li><p>Involve police only at a victim's request.</p></li>
    </ol>
    <p>If possible, all reports should be made directly to <a href="mailto:info@hasgeek.com">HasGeek</a>.</p>
