But there is a lot more that is never discussed if not for the details. In a service-oriented architecture, where dimensions and measures are coming from different sources, where some dimension is larger than the number of seconds in a year (for those who are wondering it is ~32 M), ensuring liveness and correctness at every minute is what Fireball is all about.</p>'
