      , 'summary': '<p>This talk outlines our journey which started from researching existing graphdb\'s/processing frameworks, why they didn\'t work for us at our scale and then moving on to build something. We will go in depth to explain the data-structures used and how we supported the tinker-pop graph API specification( used by all graph databases). We will also touch upon how our ad-system unique data model allowed us to come up with a fairly simplistic technique to shard the entire thing and query over it.</p>'

      , 'summary': '<p>A talk on Data Art for a tech-focused audience must introduce the essence of art (vs design) and the purpose of creating art. I\'ll introduce the field with a few teasers (conventional art vs data art) and then introduce the modes in which data can be mapped in the final art form (mostly visual attributes, and a bit of other forms of media too). This will be followed by an introduction to Generative Systems in art, where an art form evolves from data (and isn\'t completely controlled by an artist) and a categorization of these systems (with hand picked examples) that I had explored recently.</p>'

      , 'summary': '<p>Data visualisation has enabled us to compress data and express them visually in many interesting new ways. It is often cited that we are trying to tell stories through them. But, the science of data-visual-stories is still very nascent and developing. On the other hand, the art of storytelling through spoken and written words, pictures, comics and movies is very well developed and understood. Lets explore \'why\' stories work and how can we combine the science and art together to craft visual stories with data.</p>'
