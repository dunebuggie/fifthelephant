Topics include anomaly detection, applying a pre-trained model to classify images into previously unseen classes, art \'style transfer\', and reinforcement Learning inspired by AlphaGo.</p><p><i class="fa fa-calendar fa-fw"></i> 30 July 2016</p><p><i class="fa fa-clock-o fa-fw"></i> 8:45 AM to 5 PM</p><p><i class="fa fa-map-marker fa-fw"></i> <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/ahAsFdirCHM2" class="block-link" target="_blank">The Energy and Research Institute (TERI), Bangalore</a></p>'
