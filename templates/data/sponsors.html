With all our technologies—from search to Chrome to Gmail—our goal is to make it as easy as possible for you to find the information you need and get the things you need to do done. We build products that we hope will improve the web — and therefore your experience on the web better.</p><p>We also provide a variety of tools to help businesses of all kinds succeed on and off the web. While these programs form the backbone of our own business, they’ve also enabled entrepreneurs and publishers around the world to grow theirs. Our advertising programs, which range from simple text ads to rich media ads, help businesses find customers, and help publishers make money off of their content. We also provide cloud computing tools for businesses that save money and further productivity in organizations.</p><p>We will be present at The Fifth Elephant 2013 to engage with developers working in the space of big data, and support technology communities coalescing around big data, storage, cloud computing and analytics. Speak to Ashwani Sharma to learn more about our developer programs and engagement with communities.</p>'

That’s what makes it fast – 500k TPS per node with sub-millisecond latency. Hybrid architecture with indexes in-memory and data either in-memory or on flash. Strong consistency, tightly coupled clusters (auto replication, re-balancing, cross data center synchronization) reliably store billions of objects and terabytes of data. Native flash means fewer servers, less power, lower ops costs than with just DRAM. Deployed in demanding environments for almost 3 years with no downtime. You can follow them on Twitter <a href="http://twitter.com/aerospikedb">@aerospikedb</a>.</p><p>To learn more about Aerospike and how it works for businesses and developers, visit the Aerospike table at The Fifth Elephant 2013.</p><p>Eric Gold, International Sales Director, and Peter Milne, Senior Engineer, from the Aerospike team will be present at The Fifth Elephant 2013.</p>'
