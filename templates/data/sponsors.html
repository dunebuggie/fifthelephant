While these programs form the backbone of Google’s business, they have also enabled entrepreneurs and publishers around the world to grow theirs.

We also provide cloud computing tools for businesses that save money and further productivity in organizations.</p><p>Ashwani Sharma from Google will be present at The Fifth Elephant 2013 to engage with developers working in the space of big data, and to share information about Google’s developer programs and engagement with communities.</p>'

That’s what makes it fast – 500k TPS per node with sub-millisecond latency. Hybrid architecture with indexes in-memory and data either in-memory or on flash. Strong consistency, tightly coupled clusters (auto replication, re-balancing, cross data center synchronization) reliably store billions of objects and terabytes of data. Native flash means fewer servers, less power, lower ops costs than with just DRAM. Deployed in demanding environments for almost 3 years with no downtime. You can follow them on Twitter <a href="http://twitter.com/aerospikedb">@aerospikedb</a>.</p><p>To learn more about Aerospike and how it works for businesses and developers, visit the Aerospike table at The Fifth Elephant 2013.</p><p>Eric Gold, International Sales Director, and Peter Milne, Senior Engineer, from the Aerospike team will be present at The Fifth Elephant 2013.</p>'
