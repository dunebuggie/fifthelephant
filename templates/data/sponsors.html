          ThoughtWorks is a global software company and community of passionate, purpose-led
          individuals that specialise in software consulting, delivery and products.</p>
          <p>We work with people and organizations who have ambitious missions - whether they are in
          the commercial, social or government sectors. We set up smart teams who love challenges
          and think disruptively to help our clients succeed. Our Agile development tools help our
          clients continuously improve and deliver quality software.</p>
          <p>We are strong believers in the power of software and technology as tools for social change.
          Through our Social Impact Program, we collaborate with organizations with a humanitarian
          mission and broad reach, helping them use technology to make an impact.</p>
          <p>ThoughtWorks has grown from a small group in Chicago to a company of over 3600
          passionate people spread across 35 offices in 12 countries: Australia, Brazil, Canada, China,
          Ecuador, Germany, India, Singapore, South Africa, the United Kingdom, and the United
          States.</p><p><b>Mission</b></p>
          <p>Our mission is to better humanity through software and help drive the creation of a socially
          and economically just world. We bring together the most capable, driven and passionate
          people.</p>
          <p>The three pillar model includes:</p>
          <p>1. Run a sustainable business</p>
          <p>2. Champion software excellence and revolutionize the IT industry</p>
          <p>3. Advocate passionately for social and economic justice</p>
          <p><b>Culture</b></p>
          <p>Wherever we are in the world, ThoughtWorkers share the same cultural characteristics and
          imperatives. ThoughtWorks is a place where inspired people come to form connections and
          learn new skills. Our rule is: Be adventurous. Remove the constraints of enforced
          objectives and open the door to serendipity, immersion, and the fun of not knowing what&#39;s
          going to happen or who you are going to meet next. The collaborative (literally cubicle-less)
          working environment nurtures ownership. The organisation also treasures and encourages
          a healthy work life balance.</p>
          <p>We come to work as ourselves. We enjoy each other’s company. We value honesty and
          transparency. Appearances and backgrounds aren’t important to us; ideas and doing the
          right thing are.</p>'
