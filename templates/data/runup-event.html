The key lies in being able to get insights into what\'s happening on your app and in your production systems quickly and without failure.</p><p>In this talk we discuss Hyperion: a fault tolerant, real time, distributed event tracking and analysis system. The system allows clients to push, store and analyze event data to gain long term and short term insight in a collection of related systems. It is designed to be scalable, flexible and reliable, and provides real-time histograms, trends and query features. Hyperion is built as a platform for event storage, query and processing. It provides capabilities to the clients to build very powerful apps on top of it. We\'ll go through the architecture, performance and learnings from the system.</p><p>Santanu Sinha is an architect working on real-time analytics and next generation systems at flipkart.com. Prior work include developing the distributed content ingestion framework that powers meta and content ingestion for all books and ebooks on flipkart.com.</p>'
