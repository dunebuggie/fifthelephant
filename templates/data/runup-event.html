The system allows clients to push, store and analyze event data to gain long term and short term insight in a collection of related systems. It is designed to be scalable, flexible and reliable, and provides real-time histograms, trends and query features. Hyperion is built as a platform for event storage, query and processing. It provides capabilities to the clients to build very powerful apps on top of it. We\'ll go through the architecture, performance and learnings from the system.</p><p>Santanu Sinha is an architect working on real-time analytics and next generation systems at flipkart.com.

The same data can be visualised in many (MANY!) ways. Without exploring the data, you will end up visualising all your data in pie, line and bar charts. This talk will explain how to decide which visualisation to use, what are the best practises, how to study the properties of data, how it impacts design and ends with a case study. Ritvvij will share some his organisation's experiments with data driven blogs, data rooms and how they think about the future of technology in data journalism might be.</p><p class="push-3q-top"><div class="all-caps push-half-bottom">Speaker</div><span class="semi-bold">Ritvvij Parrikh</span> is a programmer, information designer and founder of Pykih Data Visualization.</p><p>Twitter: <a target="_blank" href="http://twitter.com/ritvvijparrikh">@ritvvijparrikh</a></p>'

In data storage, we'd like to have the flexibility to scale up or down on demand.</p><p>In this run-up event, we will discuss three open-source technologies which can be used for storing Big Data.</p><p><h5>Gluster <a href="http://www.gluster.org/">(http://www.gluster.org/)</a></h5>GlusterFS is an open source, distributed file system capable of scaling to several petabytes and handling thousands of clients. It has hadoop plugin by which MapReduce jobs can be run on GlusterFS volumes.</p><p><h5>Ceph <a href="https://ceph.com/">(https://ceph.com/)</a></h5>Ceph is an open-source, massively scalable, software-defined storage system which provides object, block and file system storage in a single platform. It also has a plug-in for hadoop.</p><p><h5>Swift <a href="swift.openstack.org">(swift.openstack.org)</a></h5>The OpenStack Object Store project â€“ Swift â€“ offers cloud storage software so that you can store and retrieve lots of data with a simple API. It is built for scale and optimized for durability, availability, and concurrency across the entire dataset. Swift is ideal for storing unstructured data that can grow without bounds. It also has integration with hadoop.</p>'

The focus of the workshop will be on breadth rather than depth. A lot of methods will be introduced, but their mathematical properties wonâ€™t be discussed in detail.</p><p>As a caveat, most of the real-life problems cannot be solved efficiently without further detailed understanding of these algorithms.
