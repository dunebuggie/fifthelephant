Julia provides a sophisticated compiler, distributed parallel execution, numerical accuracy, and an extensive mathematical function library. The library, largely written in Julia itself, also integrates mature, best-of-breed C and Fortran libraries for linear algebra, random number generation, signal processing, and string processing.</p><p>The base julia repository has received contributions from over 135 contributors. In addition, the Julia developer community has contributed over 125 external packages through Juliaâ€™s built-in package manager. Viral Shah, co-creator of Julia, is based in Bangalore and has a keen interest in growing the local Julia user and developer community.  Viral will be present at The Fifth Elephant to speak to attendees about Julia language and how they can participate.</p><p>The <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!forum/julia-users">julia-users</a>, <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!forum/julia-dev">julia-dev</a> and <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!forum/julia-stats">julia-stats</a> mailing lists are open for discussion around usage of Julia, development and discussions related to statistical programming. Many Julia users and developers hang out in the <a href="http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=julia">#julia IRC channel</a> on Freenode.</p>'
