      The Fifth Elephant 2013 is a unique conference that brings engineering and business professionals under one roof to discuss technology and application challenges associated with managing and processing large volumes of data.
    </p>
    <p class="regular">
      <span class="fill-fixme">Single block of crisp, unified and to-the-point agenda.</span>
      Technology Agenda: Exposure to different technology stacks and why some approaches to data storage and analytics problems work for some domains. Meet business organizations to understand why and how they adopted open source choices and enterprise solutions for their data storage and processing requirements. Interact with decision-makers, product managers to understand how these technologies fit into business processes and goals.   
      Business Agenda: Introduction to technology and its applications for better customer targeting, building products, improving business processes within the organisation. Better understanding of the contexts in which data is generated. Interact with analysts and technologists and learn how data collection and processing techniques work in different sectors and enterprises.   
    </p>

        The conference covers two major themes: storage and analytics. Sessions under each theme will be organized into separate engineering and business tracks. 
      </p>
      <h4 class="space-two-top space-half-bottom semi-bold">Engineering track on Storage</h4>
      <p>
       Developers will learn about databases and big data, OLTP, NoSQL, data integration and warehousing and issues concerning performance, speed, scaling and other challenges associated with different storage technologies. The storage track will lay the foundation for better understanding of analytics because volume of data is both a storage and analysis issue â€“ both are strongly intertwined and affect each other.
      </p>
      <h4 class="space-two-top space-half-bottom semi-bold">Business track on Storage</h4>
      <p>
        This track will cover decision support issues such as costs of storage infrastructure and benefits and limitations of some of the available technologies for different domains. Talks will also address how short-term and long-term maintenance of infrastructure ties in with business processes and goals. Panel discussions and interactive Q&A sessions between solution architects, decision-makers and engineers will further clarify these issues.
      </p>
      <h4 class="space-two-top space-half-bottom semi-bold">Analytics track for Analysts</h4>
      <p>
        This track will feature talks on metrics, tools and statistical techniques for collecting data and their application for specific use-cases. 
      </p>
      <h4 class="space-two-top space-half-bottom semi-bold">Analytics track for engineers</h4>
      <p>
        While the analyst track is for the algorithmically curious, the analytics track for developers will cover hacky territory: applications and technologies for processing, better data collection and teasing insights from data. Case studies of platforms and solutions built to tackle problems of data collection, processing and analytics will be showcased in this track.  
      </p>
      <h4 class="space-two-top space-half-bottom semi-bold">CIO and Product Managers' track on Analytics</h4>
      <p>
        The most important question dogging organizations is how do you use data to make decisions, build products and leverage the insights for business goals. This track will consist of presentations from practitioners and from domains where data has been used effectively for targeting customers, building products and developing in-house technology capabilities for better business processes.
